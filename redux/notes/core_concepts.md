# Core concepts:
 
1.  **Application state is described as a plain object**
For example, the state of a todo app might look like this:

```
{
  todos: [{
    text: 'Eat food',
    completed: true
  }, {
    text: 'Exercise',
    completed: false
  }],
  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED'
}
```

2. **To change something in the state, you need to dispatch an action.**
An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes what happened. Here are a few example actions:

```
{ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Go to swimming pool' }
{ type: 'TOGGLE_TODO', index: 1 }
{ type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER', filter: 'SHOW_ALL' }
```
3. **Finally, to tie state and actions together, we write a function called a reducer.**

Reducer is just a function that takes state and action as arguments, and returns the next state of the app.

It would be hard to write such a function for a big app, so we write smaller functions managing parts of the state:

```
function visibilityFilter(state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {
  if (action.type === 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER') {
    return action.filter
  } else {
    return state
  }
}
â€Š
function todos(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return state.concat([{ text: action.text, completed: false }])
    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
      return state.map(
        (todo, index) =>
          action.index === index
            ? { text: todo.text, completed: !todo.completed }
            : todo
      )
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```
And we write another reducer that manages the complete state of our app by calling those two reducers for the corresponding state keys:

```
function todoApp(state = {}, action) {
  return {
    todos: todos(state.todos, action),
    visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(state.visibilityFilter, action)
  }
}
```
This is basically the whole idea of Redux.
